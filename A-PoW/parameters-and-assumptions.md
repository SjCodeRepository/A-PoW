We conduct experiments on a computer which is equipped with Intel Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and runs Windows 10 operating system，
utilize Docker to simulate IoT devices and limit the CPU usage of the containers.We divide all worker nodes into six groups, and 
use a container that occupies the full load of the system as a service node. The experimental parameters are
as follows：
